  <h1 id="remix">Scratch Remix</h1>
            Starting with a default scratch template, we had to "remix" it and add a little flair. The Crab used to only go in circles changing costumes, but we made it do a little extra stuff.
  <h1 id="scratch">Scratch From Scratch</h1>
  			Scratch from scratch was just that- from scratch. Starting from nothing we recreated the origional galaga game from ancient human history.
             <br>
             
  <h1 id="Gliffy">TBA Gliffy</h1>
  			For a text based adventure, we had to start with a plan. Using gliffy we made a little map of where we wanted to start and the branching paths you could take. 
             <br>
            <br>
  <h1 id="TBA">Text Based Adventure</h1>
  			This was the actual finished project of the Text Based Adventure. Using if;then;else; statements and user inputs, it's a semi-linear story of a man who lost his memory. 
             <br>

  <h1 id="Piano">Piano With Brooks</h1>
  			The App Inventor project was a more interesting one, and not only because I was working with Brooks. We made from scratch, just a simple piano game with the basic keys of a piano. It also features a "play along" feature to the song Heart and Soul.
             <br>

  <h1 id="Arduino">Arduino</h1>
  			The Arduino project was a pretty cool one. This wasn't from scratch, it was following guides; however, it felt like it was from scratch because there isn't one helpful guide on the internet for any project.
